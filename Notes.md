## Notes

A hash is essentially a summary of the original data.

Bitcoin uses SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)-256 hash. SHA-256 is an algorithm that simply turns any kind of data into a standard-size (256 bits) hash. One input always generates the same hash, but it is impossible to predict the input back from the hash.

ðŸ’… Fun fact: SHA-256 was actually developed by the National Security Agency in the US.

Single Chain:

Distributed Chain:

Which chain represents the truth? (Is it single chain or distributed chain)

1) If you enable truthful blocks to be added more quickly, you can make more truthful blockchains.

Then the longest chain will be the most truthful chain.

2) If new blocks only gets added to the longest blockchain, this further supports the longest and the most truthful blockchain.

There are two fundamental, interdependent tweaks we will implement. We will make it faster to add blocks that are truthful and we will then assume the longest chain is the most truthful chain for the network to use .
